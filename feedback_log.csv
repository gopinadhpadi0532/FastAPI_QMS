ICD-10-CM codes have 3-7 characters.  A 3-character code is only used if it's not further subdivided.  A code is invalid if it's not coded to the full required number of characters, including the 7th character if applicable. To select a code, locate the term in the Alphabetic Index, then verify the code in the Tabular List.  Use both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List; the Alphabetic Index may not provide the full code.  The Tabular List is needed to select the full code, including laterality and any 7th character. A dash (-) at the end of an Alphabetic Index entry means additional characters are required. Even without a dash, check the Tabular List to ensure a 7th character isn't needed.  Complete and consistent medical record documentation is crucial for accurate coding.  The entire record should be reviewed to determine the reason for the encounter and conditions treated.
